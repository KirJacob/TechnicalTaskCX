Exercise 1. A 3x3 grid is filled with digits (0 ≤ d ≤ 9). Example of the grid:
5 2 2
0 3 6
4 4 1
The sum of each row, and each column, and each diagonal has the value 9. Implement a Java
method which effectively calculates a number of ways filling a 3x3 grid with the digits (0 ≤ d ≤ 9)
so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum.
